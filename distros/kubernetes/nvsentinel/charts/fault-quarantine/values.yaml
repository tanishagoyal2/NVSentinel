# Label prefix for node labels and annotations
# Used to generate label keys like: <labelPrefix>cordon-by, <labelPrefix>cordon-reason, <labelPrefix>cordon-timestamp
# Also used for uncordon labels: <labelPrefix>uncordon-by, <labelPrefix>uncordon-reason, <labelPrefix>uncordon-timestamp
# These labels track the quarantine/uncordon lifecycle and help with debugging and auditing

# Circuit breaker configuration to prevent cascading failures
# The circuit breaker prevents quarantining too many nodes in the cluster at once
# If the percentage threshold is exceeded, the circuit breaker trips and new quarantine actions are blocked
# The circuit breaker state is stored in a ConfigMap and persists across restarts
circuitBreaker:
  # Enable/disable circuit breaker protection (passed as command-line arg to the deployment)
  enabled: true
  # Maximum percentage of cluster nodes that can be quarantined before circuit breaker trips
  # Example: 50 means if 50% or more nodes are cordoned, no new quarantines will be allowed
  percentage: 50
  # Time window for the sliding window circuit breaker
  # The circuit breaker counts cordon events within this time window
  # Example: "5m" means if 50% of nodes are cordoned within any 5-minute window, the circuit breaker trips
  duration: "5m"

# Rule sets for node quarantine actions
# Each ruleset defines conditions (match) and actions (taint, cordon) to apply when conditions are met
# Rules are evaluated using CEL (Common Expression Language) expressions
# Multiple rulesets can be defined and are evaluated in order
ruleSets:
  - # Ruleset version (for future compatibility and migration)
    version: "1"
    # Human-readable name for the ruleset (used in logs and metrics)
    name: "GPU fatal error ruleset"
    # Match conditions - defines when this ruleset should trigger
    match:
      # All conditions must be true (AND logic)
      # Use 'any' for OR logic - at least one condition must be true

        # Match health events from gpu-health-monitor with fatal GPU errors

    # Optional: Taint configuration for this ruleset
    # Taints are applied to nodes to repel pods without matching tolerations
    # Uncomment to enable tainting for this ruleset
    # taint:
    #   # Taint key (used to identify the taint)
    #   key: "nvidia.com/gpu-error"
    #   # Taint value (additional information about the taint)
    #   value: "fatal"
    #   # Taint effect determines how it affects pod scheduling
    #   # NoSchedule: New pods without toleration won't be scheduled
    #   # PreferNoSchedule: Soft version of NoSchedule (scheduler tries to avoid)
    #   # NoExecute: Existing pods without toleration are evicted
    #   effect: "NoSchedule"
